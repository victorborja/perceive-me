We gather relevant information about people's personalities with a format similar to the Confession Books of the 19th century. Their photos are the starting point for strangers to put in words perceptions about them, like we normally do. Then we procede to confront these tags with the person's answers and invite the judge to add the new perceptions._\r\n\r\n![Styleguide](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victorborja/perceive-me/master/perceive-styleguide.png)\r\n![MeteorJS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/victorborja/perceive-me/master/Screen%20Shot%202015-10-27%20at%201.44.40%20AM.png)\r\n\r\nCreated by @vic and @zuraguerra","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
